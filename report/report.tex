\section{Average Magnetization as a function of temperature}

Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is generally the most common type of equation in \LaTeX: 
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:one} %Label for the equation, to be used for referencing in other parts of the document
  i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \psi + U(\mathbf{x}) \psi
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that was used in the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset using the \verb+equation*+ environment:
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Multiline equations}

You'll generally want to use the \verb+align+ environment for multiline equations. Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line (again denoted with \textbackslash\textbackslash) to avoid assigning a number, or \verb+align*+ to disable numbering entirely:
\begin{align}
  \sin(2\theta) &= 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) \nonumber \\
                &= \frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1 + \tan^2(\theta)}
\end{align}
Note how alignment occurs at the (unprinted) \verb+&+ character.

Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for using a Roman font within a math environment.

\section{Cross-referencing}
\LaTeX\ will automatically number such things as sections, footnotes, equations, figure captions, and table captions for you. In order to reference them in text, use the \verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands\footnote{Check out the \texttt{cleveref} (one r) package, too!}. To reference a particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear within the section heading (or immediately after), within the footnote text, within the equation, or within the table or figure caption. The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command is used in text at the point where the reference is to be displayed.  Some examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1}, Table~\ref{tab:table1}, and Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}.
\begin{figure}[b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/fig_1}% Imports a figure - does not automatically scale
  \caption{\label{fig:epsart} A figure caption. The figure captions are automatically numbered.}
\end{figure}

\section{Floats: Figures, Tables, etc.}
Figures (images) and tables are usually allowed to ``float'', which means that their placement is determined by \LaTeX, while the document is being typeset. 

Use the \texttt{figure} environment for a figure, the \texttt{table} environment for a table. In each case, use the \verb+\caption+ command within to give the text of the figure or table caption along with the \verb+\label+ command to provide a key for referring to this figure or table. Insert an image using either the \texttt{graphics} or \texttt{graphix} packages, which define the \verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command. (The two packages differ in respect of the optional arguments used to specify the orientation, scaling, and translation of the image.) To create an alignment, use the \texttt{tabular} environment. 

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{3}{ |c| }{Team sheet} \\
  \hline
  Goalkeeper & GK & Paul Robinson \\ \hline
  \multirow{4}{*}{Defenders} & LB & Lucus Radebe \\
   & DC & Michael Duburry \\
   & DC & Dominic Matteo \\
   & RB & Didier Domi \\ \hline
  \multirow{3}{*}{Midfielders} & MC & David Batty \\
   & MC & Eirik Bakke \\
   & MC & Jody Morris \\ \hline
  Forward & FW & Jamie McMaster \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{Strikers} & ST & Alan Smith \\
   & ST & Mark Viduka \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{tab:table1}A table, demonstrating the use of the \texttt{multirow} package for spanning rows and columns.}
\end{table}

The best place for the \texttt{figure} or \texttt{table} environment is immediately following its first reference in text; this sample document illustrates this practice for Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}, which shows a figure that is small enough to fit in a single column. In exceptional cases, you will need to move the float earlier in the document: \LaTeX's float placement algorithms need to know about a full-page-width float sooner.

The content of a table is typically a \texttt{tabular} environment, giving rows of type in aligned columns. Column entries separated by \verb+&+'s, and 
each row ends with \textbackslash\textbackslash. The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment specifies how data are aligned in the columns. 
For instance, entries may be centered, left-justified, right-justified, aligned on a decimal point. 

Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, although \LaTeX sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the table. Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+ command. Rows with that columns span multiple columns can be typeset using the \verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command (for example, see the first row of Table~\ref{tab:table1}).

\appendix

\section{Appendixes}

To start the appendixes, use the \verb+\appendix+ command. This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes instead of regular sections. Therefore, the \verb+\appendix+ command should be used only once---to setup the section commands to act as appendixes. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading for a section can be left empty. For example, 
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A'' and
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{Background}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND'' (note that the colon is set automatically).

If there is only one appendix, then the letter ``A'' should not appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix command (\verb+\appendix*+ in the place of \verb+\appendix+).

\section{A little more on appendixes}

Observe that this appendix was started by using
\begin{verbatim}
\section{A little more on appendixes}
\end{verbatim}

Note the equation number in an appendix:
\begin{equation}
  E^2=p^2c^2 + m^2c^4.
\end{equation}

\subsection{\label{app:subsec}A subsection in an appendix}

You can use a subsection or subsubsection in an appendix. Note the numbering: we are now in Appendix~\ref{app:subsec}.

Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the subequations environment:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  E^2 &= m^2c^4 \quad \text{(rest)}, \label{appa} \\
  E^2 &= m^2c^4 + p^2 c^2 \quad \text{(relativistic)}, \label{appb} \\
  E^2 &\approx p^2 c^2 \quad \text{(ultrarelativistic)} \label{appc}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).
